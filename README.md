```
Algoriths simulated:
  -- First Come First Served (FCFS): Processes requests in the order they arrive.
  -- Shortest Job First (SJF): Assigns the CPU to the process with the shortest estimated execution time, reducing waiting time.
  -- Shoreted Time Remaining (STR): Chooses the process with the least time left to complete, allowing for preemption.
  -- Round Robin (RR): Distributes CPU time equally among all processes in a cyclical fashion.
